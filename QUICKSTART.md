## Tips

- **Add your email** to get better rate limits (100K requests/day)
- Use **Boolean operators** in searches: `"AI" AND (safety OR ethics)`
- Filter by **year ranges** to focus on recent research
- Sort by **citation count** to find influential work
- Use **per_page** parameter to get more results (max 200)

## Troubleshooting

**Server not showing up in Claude Desktop?**
- Check that the path in your config is absolute, not relative
- Verify the build was successful: `ls build/index.js`
- Restart Claude Desktop completely

**Rate limit errors?**
- Make sure `OPENALEX_EMAIL` is set in your config
- Slow down your requests if hitting 10 requests/second

**No results found?**
- Try broader search terms
- Check spelling and use Boolean operators
- Try searching by DOI or OpenAlex ID directly
